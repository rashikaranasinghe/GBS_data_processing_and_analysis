## Data Processing and Analysis  
This repository provides scripts for:  
- Processing raw Genotype-by-Sequencing (GBS) data
- Performing SNP-based Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Performing genomic and phenotypic cline analysis
- Conducting admixture mapping analysis
- Constructing maximum likelihood trees with **Treemix**  
- Generating maximum-clade-credibility trees with **SNAPP**  

These scripts facilitate genomic and phenotypic analyses of hybridization dynamics in flameback woodpeckers.
